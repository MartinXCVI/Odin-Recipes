  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This Neapolitan pizza dough recipe makes two 12-inch pizzas. Apply your sauce, cheese, toppings, and a final spread of cheese to tie it all together.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 ¼ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon fast-rising dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups ice water, or as needed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon granulated garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, and yeast until thoroughly combined. Mix in ice water, scraping the bowl as you mix, until all flour and water have been incorporated into a soft dough. Mix in 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface, and knead until dough is firm but slightly sticky, mixing in more flour if needed. Knead granulated garlic and Italian seasoning into dough. (The kneading step can be done in a bread machine set on the Dough setting.)</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Form dough into a round, and place into an oiled bowl. Brush the top with 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow dough to rise until double, 1 to 2 hours. Punch down dough, and cut in half. Form each half into a 12-inch pizza crust, and place on pizza pans.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Move a rack to the bottom position in oven, and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Bake pizza crusts on the bottom rack just until firm, 3 to 7 minutes. Allow crusts to cool for about 10 minutes before topping with sauce, cheese, or other desired ingredients and returning to the oven to bake.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <p>If two pizzas are one too many, you can place half the dough in the refrigerator. Well covered, it will keep for several days. When removing, allow dough to rise at room temperature. Place in pan and cook same as above.</p>
